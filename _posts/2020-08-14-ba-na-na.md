That 87% of the Startups are unnecessary and don’t solve a real problem.

Silicon Valley produced some great companies and a legacy for ages.
Without Silicon Valley/Bay Area there probably would be no HP, Apple, Google, Uber, Dropbox etc. P.S.: (totally made those 87% up btw, that’s just what it feels like to me.)
